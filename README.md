# Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's Little Theorem states:

If `p` is a prime number, then for any integer `a` such that `a` is not divisible by `p`, the following equation holds true:

This means that `a` raised to the power of `p-1`, when divided by `p`, leaves a remainder of 1.

# Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's Little Theorem states:

If \( p \) is a prime number, then for any integer \( a \) such that \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \), the following equation holds true:

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$
